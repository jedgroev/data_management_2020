### <p align="center">4th EUROMAMMALS Summer School - University of Aveiro, Portugal <br>  July 6th - 10th, 2020</p>
# <p align="center">Data Management in Movement Ecology 2020</p>  

Data management is increasingly becoming a necessary skill for ecologists, as has already happened with statistics and GIS. This is especially true for movement ecology that can exploit data sets of ever increasing size, frequency and resolution from tagging techniques. These data come with complex associated information related to the animal characteristics, interactions and management and to the environmental context, such as population density, weather, habitat types and vegetation indexes based on remote sensing.  
This course has the objective to learn how to handle, model, store, and process in a robust and efficient way animal ecology data, and particularly the spatio-temporal information linked with movement data.  
These objectives will be pursued through a hands-on, step by step approach during an intense one-week course with a mix of technical lectures and hands-on exercises to manage and manipulate ecological data typically used in Movement Ecology.  
Proficiently following the course will provide participants with solid skills in management and analysis of ecological spatio-temporal data. At the end of the course the participants:  
* will be capacitated to use (spatial) database to store and manage their ecological data sets;  
* will master SQL and spatial SQL to retrieve and process their data;  
* will be able to use advanced animal movement database;  
* can use R in connection with a database to analyse their data.

#### REGISTRATION
Send an Email (subject: Data Management Movement Ecology 2020), containing a brief description of your PhD project and/or description of the relevance of the course to your research, along with a CV to Francesca Cagnacci (francesca.cagnacci@fmach.it) and Rita Torres (rita.torres@ua.pt).  
#### LOCATION  
District capital, the city of Aveiro is located in the Central Region of Portugal (Baixo Vouga) and has around 55,000 inhabitants. The city is evenly distributed over the lagoon landscape, since the Ria de Aveiro penetrates the urban space, crossed by a network of channels through which *moliceiros* (local colourful vessels) meander. Visiting on foot does not mean too much effort either since the city is flat, and anyone who enjoys cycling can take a *BUGA* - bicycles made freely available by Aveiro City Council. The São Jacinto Dunes Natural Reserve is about 15 minutes away, with its almost wild beaches. On the other side of the lagoon 10 km from Aveiro, Praia da Barra is a beautiful and spacious sandy beach with perfect conditions for night life and for a range of sports including surfing, bodyboarding, kite-surfing, sailing and sea fishing.
